                    Luigi's started in 2001 and has been serving only the best for authentic Italian cuisine
                    since we opened. All of our ingredients are prepared here in house and are as fresh as fresh
                    can get!

                    Luigi's was started by Luigi Ricci after he immigrated to the United States from Italy back
                    in 1998, and he wanted to bring the taste of Italy to the US!
